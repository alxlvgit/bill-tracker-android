# Bill Tracker 
I created this app as a helper to track the bills. 
The user can input the bill amount, set a date for when the bill was paid, and pick the category. 
The user can also create, delete, and modify the categories.
The summary of the bills is displayed in two ways:
- list of all categories with the total amount spent per category;
- pie chart with bills and categories.
